# Business Licensing Data Analytics on AWS

This project is part of my MBA coursework in **Cloud Computing** and demonstrates my ability to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to perform a full **Descriptive Analysis** on business licensing data from the **City of Vancouver**.

This is my **first cloud project** and my **first GitHub portfolio**, and it showcases my journey as I begin building practical cloud solutions using AWS.

---

## Project Objective

To analyze business licensing data for the City of Vancouver (1997â€“2012) using AWS cloud services and uncover patterns in license issuance and fee collection. The analysis includes multiple phases: data ingestion, profiling, cleaning, cataloging, summarization, and visualization.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/)
- **Dataset Name:** `business-licences-1997-to-2012`
- **Formats Used:** CSV and JSON
- **Folder:** [`datasets/`](./datasets/)

## Project Workflow

The project is organized into **five key phases**, each stored in its own folder with screenshots and explanations.

| Phase | Folder | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | [`phase-1-ingestion/`](./phase-1-ingestion) | Uploading dataset to S3, enabling encryption, versioning, and replication |
| **Phase 2** | [`phase-2-profiling/`](./phase-2-profiling) | Profiling the raw data using AWS Glue DataBrew |
| **Phase 3** | [`phase-3-cleaning/`](./phase-3-cleaning) | Cleaning and transforming using DataBrew recipes |
| **Phase 4** | [`phase-4-cataloging/`](./phase-4-cataloging) | Cataloging structured data using Glue Crawlers |
| **Phase 5** | [`phase-5-summarization/`](./phase-5-summarization) | Summarizing and querying using Glue Studio and Athena |

## Visualizations

Visual charts that show trends in business licensing activities:
- Issuance volume across years
- Monthly fee trends  
See: [`visualizations/`](./visualizations/)
